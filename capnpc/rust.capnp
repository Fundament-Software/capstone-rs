# Rename something in the generated code. The value that you specify in this
# annotion must follow capnp capitalization conventions. So, for example,
# a struct could be named `StructFoo`, even though that will get translated
# to a `struct_foo` module in the generated Rust code.
#
# TODO: support annoting more kinds of things with this.
